## Origins

### Garage48 Base Camp Spring 2019

Our team PetHealth was shortlisted for the Garage48 Base Camp Spring 2019 hackathon.

From a pitched idea for a collaboration platform for veterinarians to a prototype, we achieved in 3 weeks a selection to Base Camp to compete alongside other early-stage startups.

I worked as a team leader, full-stack developer and pitched the idea to the jury where we received amazing feedback and encouragement for our project.

### Student Startup Camp 2019

Participated in a 5-day camp where we were tasked to create a viable idea for a startup and an MVP. We created a collaboration platform for veterinarians to share patient history.

I presented the idea, handled the role as the team lead and a full-stack developer. It was an amazing experience with excellent guidance from mentors and founders. Our team was marvelous and created an incredibly memorable experience.

We won the Best Design Special Award for our project.
